  - Leverages the full power and flexibility of Excel for data handling
  - Allows for quick data entry in the field using laptops or tablets
  - Coaches can work offline and upload data when connected

- The import process is streamlined and user-friendly:
  1. Coaches fill out the appropriate Excel template with new data
  2. The completed template is uploaded to the system
  3. Data is automatically processed and integrated into the database
  4. The system applies appropriate scoring criteria and updates athlete profiles

- This bulk import capability offers numerous benefits:
  - Significantly reduces data entry time and minimizes errors
  - Allows coaches to quickly update the system after training sessions or competitions
  - Provides flexibility for different data collection scenarios (e.g., on-field, during travel)
  - Enables efficient collaboration among multiple coaches or staff members

By leveraging these powerful data collection and import tools, coaches can maintain up-to-date and comprehensive athlete records with minimal effort and maximum flexibility. This approach respects coaches' existing workflows and expertise with Excel, ensuring a smooth integration of the performance analytics system into their daily routines. The result is more time for analysis and athlete development, with less time spent on data entry and system learning.

### 2. Score Calculation

Raw performance data is converted into standardized scores based on the scoring criteria.

- The system converts raw scores into standardized notes (typically 0-100)
- Factors considered include:
  - The athlete's raw score
  - Scoring criteria for the specific exercise, group, and gender
  - Evaluation method (highest or lowest score is best)
- Scoring coefficients are applied to weight the importance of each exercise
- Time-based exercises are converted to a standardized format for consistent evaluation

### 3. Skill Rating Aggregation And Visualization

Scores from related exercises are aggregated to produce overall skill ratings for each athlete.
